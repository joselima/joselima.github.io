In the last day, after being in Germany for just over 4 days, I decided to still attend the morning talks and take a look at the sketching workshop (which I left after the break: I was tired, and I'm really poor at drawing, which meant that I couldn't even concentrate on what we were asked to do, so I thought I'd give it another go another time). Here are the key points in the morning talks I attended.

**"Natural born testers. Are you one? If not, then become one!" by Graham Thomas**

* A natural born tester is someone who tests by default. Whatever. Not destructively, or maliciously, just out of habit, or compulsion, a what if?;
* who is a natural born tester in this picture?

  * Hopefully you guessed (3)
* why lemmings?
  * skills - multi-tasking, parallel processing, problem solving, time management, goal oriented, fun
* why play railroad tycoon?
  * all about planning, management, different views by context
  * monitoring, measuring and predicting
  * controlling
  * adapting to change
  * reacting to change
  * fun
* angry birds:
  * teaches you to explorer your content
  * simple solution is not always optimal
  * different techniques
  * combine techniques
  * plan
  * think in the abstract
* playing angry (test) birds - hit different parts of the code
* learn through play - raspberry pi, penguin puzzle

**"Don't you trust me?" by Seb Rose**

* Go through the behaviours with the business, everyone involved, stakeholders, look for the knowns and the unknowns;
* our systems can be described as behaviours of our system;
* Cucumber is good because it will bring everyone together to specify software - developers, testers, BAs, product owners;
* it also helps you give live documentation which is why it has some advantage over other tools;
* what is the problem with this collaboration in BDD?
  * some places aren't quite as agile as they think they are
  * talking to each other - BDD actually helps with this because you need to speak to each other
* look at different components, don't just test drive them;
* regaining trust
* too many organisations are; agile in the way that are not what we would like to think about it - they are still too structured;
* Ron Jeffries - No Estimates;
* testing pyramid (unit/integration/end-to-end/exploratory&manual);
* ice-cream collapse pattern

* don't treat acceptance tests as system tests - both are different and have a different audience;
* be careful what you test with BDD - it's expensive, certain things you can go directly to the method and test it there
